	 * Entries for each Beeminder graph the user uses with TagTime. Each
	 * entry in this set is in the format <code>graphname|tags</code>.
	 * Tags may contain any characters except commas, right square
	 * brackets, whitespace, and - signs at the start. (Actually, - signs
	 * at the start are allowed; they just have a different meaning and
	 * aren't parsed as part of the tag.)
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * For example, if a user with username alice had the entry
	 * <code>work|job work</code>, all pings including at least one of
	 * "job" or "work" would be sent to www.beeminder.com/alice/work.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Additionally, if any tag is preceded by a - sign, that tag must
	 * <em>not</em> be present for the ping to be submitted to the
	 * specified graph. If some tags have - signs, the ping will be
	 * submitted if <em>none</em> of the - tags are present, and at least
	 * one of the other tags is. For example, the entry
	 * <code>computeridle|afk retro -off</code> will send pings such as
	 * "afk" and "afk RETRO", but it will not send "afk off RETRO" or
	 * "research for work".
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that tag matching is case insensitive: the above entry will
	 * match pings with "Afk Retro" as well as "afk RETRO", but the two
	 * would show up differently in the log.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Special case: if every tag has a - sign, the requirement for at
	 * least one matching tag will be waived. For example,
	 * <code>nafk|-afk</code> will submit any ping without "afk" to the
	 * "nafk" graph. Pings can be submitted to any number of graphs, so
	 * "job" would be submitted to both the "work" graph and the "nafk"
	 * graph.
